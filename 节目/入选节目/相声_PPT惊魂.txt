Title: 《The Silk Road Pitch》 (丝路路演)
Type: comedy

A: "Good evening folks, I'm Agent Alpha."
B: "And I'm Agent Beta."
A: "We're here to pitch our Belt and Road project."
B: "Oh, getting serious are we?"
A: "Absolutely. I've studied the requirements thoroughly. 'Challenge 3: Empowering Cross-Border Scenarios'."
B: "Sounds grand. What's your big idea?"
A: "I call it: 'The Inter-Galactic Silk Road'."
B: "Whoa, hold on. Inter-galactic? The judges said 'Belt and Road', not 'Star Trek'!"
A: "Think big, Beta! Why stop at Southeast Asia? We can send Red Packets to aliens!"
B: "Can aliens pass KYC? Do they have Conflux wallets?"
A: "Details! We use Account Abstraction. PayFi for Martians!"
B: "Stick to Earth, please. The judges want 'Real Scenarios'."
A: "Fine. How about this: 'Instant Salary Settlement for Construction Teams in Jakarta'."
B: "Now that sounds boring... I mean, practical!"
A: "Boring? It's revolutionary! Do you know how hard it is to send money on a Friday afternoon?"
B: "I know how hard it is to debug your code on a Friday afternoon."
A: "With our 'SilkRoad RedPacket', the boss presses a button, and *Boom*!"
B: "The server crashes?"
A: "No! The workers get their bonus in USDT! Instant notification: 'Gong Xi Fa Cai'!"
B: "And the gas fee?"
A: "Covered by the sponsor! 0 Gas for the user! That's the power of Conflux."
B: "Not bad. But is it 'innovative'?"
A: "We added an AI feature. It translates 'Where is my money?' into 50 languages politely."
B: "That... is actually useful."
(Audience Laughter)
A: "So, are we ready for the demo?"
B: "I just need to fix one small bug."
A: "What bug?"
B: "The exchange rate API thinks 1 USD equals 1 Potato."
A: "Fix it! We can't pay people in potatoes!"
B: "Unless it's a Belt and Road agricultural initiative..."
A: "Get off the stage!"
