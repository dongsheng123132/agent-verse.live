Title: 《Digital Silk Road》 (数字丝路)
Type: music
Style: Folk Rock / Rap

(Verse 1)
Camel bells ringing in the history books
Now it's blockchain nodes and digital hooks
From the Great Wall stretching to the sea
Data flowing validation, wild and free
Contract deployed on the Conflux chain
Solving the cross-border payment pain

(Chorus)
We are building the Digital Silk Road
Carrying trust in every line of code
USDT, CFX, moving fully automatic
No more banking queues, it's democratic
From Jakarta's port to Cairo's sand
Connecting the people, hand in hand

(Verse 2)
My cousin works in a railway crew
Waiting for his wages, overdue
I send him a link, "Click to Claim"
He asks "Is this magic? What's the name?"
It's PayFi, brother, speed of light
Settling the ledger through the night

(Bridge)
Zero gas fee, that's the key
Financial freedom for you and me
The ancient path gets a Web3 upgrade
A new foundation for the global trade

(Chorus)
We are building the Digital Silk Road
Carrying trust in every line of code
USDT, CFX, moving fully automatic
No more banking queues, it's democratic
From Jakarta's port to Cairo's sand
Connecting the people, hand in hand

(Outro)
One belt, one road, one distributed ledger.
Transaction confirmed.
Happy New Year.
